Solutions for the Unige course Optimization II 

[The website can be found here on readthedocs.io](https://optimization-ii-2021.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

To run the notebooks locally, you can use the `environment.yml` file. Running the following line of 
code in command line will create a new Annaconda environment `optimizationII`. 
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

To build the website yourself run
```
make html
```

or for the pdf version (this requires a LaTeX installation with a bunch of extra packages)
```
make latexpdf
```
