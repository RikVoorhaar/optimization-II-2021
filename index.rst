Welcome to the solutions website for Optimization II
====================================================

This page contains all of the solution for the Unige Course Optimization II. The solutions are shown
as webpages, but if you prefer you can download a PDF version by `clicking on this link
<https://optimization-ii-2021.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/>`_.

All of the solutions are also avalaible as Jupyter notebooks. You can open these notebooks on
`Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/>`_ by clicking the button 'Open in Colab' at the 
top of each page.

Some of the homeworks will require you to write some Python code yourself. For this we advice you to
use Colab, since it will not require you to install anything. You can also run all of the code
locally by installing `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads>`_. Other
than the packages that come standard with Anaconda, you should install `CVXPY
<https://www.cvxpy.org/>`_, a package for convex optimization.
